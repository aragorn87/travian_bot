# travian_bot
A bot to automate the early game tactics for the online game strategy game 'Travian'. The script will help a user navigate the early game mundane tasks of ramping up upgrades on the resource units. The script runs continously and queues up upgrades when there are enough resources and the queue pipeline is empty.

WARNING: Usage of the script will most likely get you banned. Use it at your own discretion.

Instructions:
1. Log into your Travian account using a browser.
2. Change the account details in the script file (username, password)
3. Preferably run the script on Jupyter notebook using the same browser
